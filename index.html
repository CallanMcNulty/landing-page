                <h4>Programming</h4>
                <p>During my freshman year of college I was a humanities student in need of a science credit. I had heard the Intro to computer science was a fun course, and I had always had an interest in technology, so I signed up. That class was my first taste of programming. There were a lot of students in that course who were just in it for the science credit, and they mostly left computer science after that one introductory course, but I liked it enough that I kept with it for two more courses, Data Structures &amp; Algorithms and Natural Language Processing. Throughout these courses I gained quite a bit of experience with Python and a bit of C++ along with a certain amount of theoretical computer science knowledge. After my sophomore year, I decided to focus more on my majors and stopped taking computer science courses, but I continued to dabble in coding, spending some time aquiring a basic understanding of Javascript. Now, after graduation, I have decided to return to coding, and I am now a student at Epicodus.</p>

                <h4>Non-Programming</h4>
                <p>I was born in Toms River, NJ in 1993, and spent a good portion of my childhood in the South Jersey Area. When I was seven, my family moved to southeastern Pennsylvania, where I did most of my growing up. I attended Swarthmore College from 2011 to 2015 where I double-majored in Philosophy and Linguistics. I had thought I might pursue a career in academia, but eventually decided against it. During my summers away from school and during the intervening year between college and Epicodus, I worked at the circulation desk at a public library. In the spring of 2016 I moved to Portland Oregon to study programming. When I am not working or studying, I can typically be found reading books, reading blog posts, writing blog posts, looking at art, making art, or perhaps I wll just be lost in thought.</p>
